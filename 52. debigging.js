/*
    ======================== JavaScript Debugging ======================

    -  Errors can (will) happen, every time you write some new computer code.

    ---------------------------- Code Debugging ------------------------

    -   Programming code might contain syntax errors, or logical errors
    -   Many of these errors are difficult to diagnose
    -   Often, when programming code contains errors, nothing will happen. There are no error messages, and you will get no indications where to search for errors.
    -   Searching for (and fixing) errors in programming code is called code debugging.

        ------------------------- Setting Breakpoints ----------------------

        In the debugger window, you can set breakpoints in the JavaScript code
        At each breakpoint, JavaScript will stop executing, and let you examine JavaScript values
        After examining values, you can resume the execution of code (typically with a play button)

        ------------------------- The debugger Keyword ---------------------

     -   The debugger keyword stops the execution of JavaScript, and calls (if available) the debugging function.
     -   This has the same function as setting a breakpoint in the debugger
     -   If no debugging is available, the debugger statement has no effect
     -   With the debugger turned on, this code will stop executing before it executes the third line
